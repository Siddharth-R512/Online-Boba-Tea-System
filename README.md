# Online Boba Tea Ordering System

The Online Boba Tea Ordering System is a Java-based application that allows users to order boba tea online. The system includes user authentication, menu browsing, order placement, and an admin dashboard for managing orders and inventory. The project is built using Java Swing in an MVC architecture, ensuring a clear separation between the application logic, user interface, and data.

The main features include:
- User login and registration
- Viewing and selecting items from the boba tea menu
- Customizing orders with different toppings and sizes
- Order summary and checkout process
- Admin dashboard for managing orders and menu items

## Project Structure
The system follows an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. Below are the key components:

- **Login.java**: Handles user authentication, including login and registration functionality. It interacts with the user interface for logging in and communicates with the backend to verify user credentials.

- **Dashboard.java**: Represents the admin dashboard where the administrator can view and manage orders, update the menu, and monitor the system's overall performance.
